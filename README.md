Task 3: SQL for Data Analysis
Overview
This project is part of my Data Analyst Internship. The main objective of this task was to practice SQL for data extraction, analysis, and optimization using MySQL (or PostgreSQL/SQLite). I used an Ecommerce database (or any suitable dataset) to write and execute SQL queries.

What I did:
Wrote queries using SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, and GROUP BY.
Applied different types of JOINS (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT).
Created subqueries for more complex data analysis.
Used aggregate functions like SUM and AVG.
Built Views for simplified data reporting.
Focused on query optimization techniques using indexes.
Attached screenshots of output along with the SQL files.

Skills Learned:
Data manipulation and filtering using SQL
Complex data relationships using JOINs
Subqueries and Aggregations
Query optimization for performance
Working with Views in databases
